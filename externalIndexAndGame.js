//click start to begin the game's main function

//make an array with 9 values

//loop a math.random function and assign a random number to each array value,
// so i will end up with 9 random numbers.


//all 9 buttons will be hidden by default, and then when pressed they will
//display the appropriate image based on the mathematical value of the value

//the user must get 3 matching images in a row to win the game, it is completely luck based.
